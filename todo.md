# TO DO
1) Move the alexa on the table and make it smaller. 
2) Think of a way in which I can let you see what is where and what collides with what. I want to make the experience easy on the developer and on the AI.
3) remove the window from the game
4) there is a cutout in the office.glb. I want to add a picture of a city behind it, so that it looks like a window.
5) interacting with objects should not work in the pause menu. think of a way to fix it for any future features.
