# The Final Button - Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for "The Final Button", a browser-based puzzle game for a game jam.

## Phase 1: Starter Menu & Scene Setup (Day 1)

*   [x] Set up the basic HTML, CSS, and JS files.
*   [x] Create a starter menu with a "Start Game" button and a "Skip Introduction" toggle.
