# The Final Button
### A game for Junior Accelerator Game Jam 2025

## Idea
You are **Evil**s Presley, the person on the verge to **destroy the earth**. You are sitting on your desk and ***just need to click*** on the button in front of you and it all will be gone.

For some reason **the button is locked in a cage** and you cant seem to remember why or how to unlock it. 

Start exploring what is around you and find a way to unlock the button and click it. 

Your time is limited, the police is already on your traces and will find you within 10 minutes.

Go fast or go home!
