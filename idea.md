## Game Idea
You are the main character. You are the most evil person and are on the verge to destroy the earth. You are sitting on your desk in your office with a great view of many distant buildings. You just need to click on the button in front of you and it all will be gone. But it is locked in a cage and you cant seem to remember how to unlock it. Start exploring what is around you and find a way to unlock the button and click it. But your time is limited. You remember that the police is after you (a minute in the game after explaination of what you have to do (skippable)).

## Notes of the Idea
- the timer starts a minute into the gameplay after the introduction to the game has been made.
- there is a toggle to remove this introduction and the timer starts right away
- you cant do anything except looking around while the introduction is going on
- the timer is 10 minutes and is shown
- if the timer reaches 0, a cinematic of how the police is comming in and getting you is shown
- if the player unlocks the button and clicks it, he sees a rocket through the window and it hits the ground, making the screen white; show end credits
- the game should be easily playable on mobile phone or desktop with only a mouse

## Puzzle Ideas
1.  A key is hidden somewhere in the room. The key opens a drawer in the desk.
2.  Inside the drawer is a piece of paper with a riddle.
3.  The answer to the riddle is a word. The word is a password to the computer.
4.  On the computer, there is a file with the combination for the lock.
